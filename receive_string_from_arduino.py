import serial # Module needed for serial communication
 
# Set the port name and the baud rate. This baud rate should match the
# baud rate set on the Arduino.
# Timeout parameter makes sure that program doesn't get stuck if data isn't
# being received. After 1 second, the function will return with whatever data
# it has. The readline() function will only wait 1 second for a complete line 
# of input.
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM0', 9600, timeout=1)
 
# Get rid of garbage/incomplete data
ser.flush()
 
# Infinite loop

  # If there is data available
  if(ser.in_waiting > 0):
   
    # Read everything until the new line character
    # Convert the data from a byte into a string of type 'utf-8'
    # You could also use 'ascii'
    # rstrip() function removes trailing characters like
    # the new line character '\n'
    line = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').rstrip()
     
    # Print the data received from the Arduino
